qlog
====

qlog is a small Qt-based, thread-safe logging library. It defines a
few macros to log your messages at different levels, and other macros
to globally or selectively turn on/off logging.

At the moment it's so small that I suggest, if you want to use it, to
grab the files and throw them in your project.

Obviously this might not be a good choice for large and complex
projects, but if you want something small to use in your throwaway
program, and you want it to accept QStrings and have a name with the
"q" at the beginning, this is a good choice for your.

Have fun!
